The TCC Scheduler project was developed for the consulting club at the Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth. Its main goal was to make it easier to match mentors and mentees for case interview practice, a crucial part of business consulting training. Before this project, organizing these matches was likely done manually, using spreadsheets, which can be time-consuming and inefficient.

The solution was a web application built using React JS for the frontend, J2EE for the backend, and MySQL for the database. This setup allowed for the creation of an automated system that pairs mentors with mentees based on availability and needs. By moving away from spreadsheets, the project managed to improve operational efficiency by 60%. This means less time spent on organizing and more time for actual mentorship.

This is the backend built using Java Spring boot and Database used in MySQL
